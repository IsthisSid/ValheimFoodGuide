# ValheimFoodGuide
## An iOS App Project Using SwiftUI
### Project Description
#### Background
Hiya fellow coder :wave:. This was my first practice with SwiftUI, and I thought it would be fun to create a resource guide for the multiplayer survival game *Valheim*. 
I play in a large gaming community and we spend a lot of time researching resources and food stats. 
So, why not create an app that lists all the stats nicely on my iPhone? I can check it quickly before a troll attacks me with his club :sweat_smile:.

#### App Details
* Food items are displayed on the first screen along with a short description. Tap an item and you will see a more detailed description
as well as a dropdown listing all the stats (health, stamina, duration). I also included a link to [Valheim Wiki Food](https://valheim.fandom.com/wiki/Food).
* The programming language I used was Swift.
* Some features I hope to implement in the future: adding search-bar and better quality images. I would like to keep it as simple as possible.<br>
#### How to View My Project
