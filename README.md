# ValheimFoodGuide
## An iOS App Project Using SwiftUI
### Project Description
#### Background
Hiya fellow coder :wave:. This was my first practice with SwiftUI, and I thought it would be fun to create a resource guide for the multiplayer survival game [Valheim](https://www.valheimgame.com/). 
I play in a large gaming community and we spend a lot of time researching resources and food stats. 
So, why not create an app that lists all the stats nicely on my iPhone? I can check it quickly before a troll attacks me with his club :sweat_smile:.
<br>
#### App Details
* Design and UI: Food items are displayed on the first screen along with a short description. When an item is tapped, a larger image appears along with a more detailed description. There is also a dropdown feature, once clicked, it will display a list of stats (health, stamina, duration, and healing per tick).
* Programming language used: Swift.
* Features I hope to implement in the future: search-bar and higher quality images.<br>
